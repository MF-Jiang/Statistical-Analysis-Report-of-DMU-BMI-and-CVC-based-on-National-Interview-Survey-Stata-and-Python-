# Statistical-Analysis-Report-of-DMU-BMI-and-CVC-based-on-National-Interview-Survey-Stata-and-Python
This is the content of the statistics placement exam of Weill Cornell's health informatics. In the library are the scripts and reports I made at that time.

Your task is to provide an statistical report (you select the format) by analyzing a data set from the National Interview Survey(https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/2022nhis.htm). This dataset is available  as attachment to this exam and was sourced  from adult22csv.Links to an external site.

The codebook to the dataset is available at adult-codebook.pdfLinks to an external site. 

Some studies has suggested that life styles are associated with cardiovascular diseases. The dataset has some life style variables such as diet, coffee, alcohol and smoking.  You need to provide

1. A "Table 1"  that includes at least 3 demographic variables (i.e., sex, age, race, and place of residence).  Hint: follow the recommendations at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6773463/Links to an external site. or similar source.  (20 points)

2. Describe differences on the life styles and cardiovascular conditions based on the demographics selected for table 1? Please report those findings. (20 points)

3. Please describe the relationship between some of these life styles (At least 3), the  category of weight and the presence of cardiovascular conditions. hint:  look into variables that are part of the DMU: Diet and Nutrition of the survey, BMI: body mass index, CVC: cardiovascular conditions.  (40 points)

4. Your report should include as description of the software that you use to analyze the data, the procedures that you conducted and the reason to perform them. (15 points)

5. Provide as appendix or attachments (5 points)
   
   A. the source code for such analysis,

   B. the raw outputs of your code.
   

Statistics Report Criteria

a. Table 1

   Table 1 includes 3 demographic variables provides absolute numbers and proportions

b. Differences

   Table 1 is used to present the difference in lifestyles

c. Regression, Association or Correlation analysis

   Students present an analysis that is informed properly by a hypothesis, factors and outcomes are properly differentiate, and a significance is interpreted

d. Methods justification

   Student explain clearly the reason to select the methods

e. Source code
